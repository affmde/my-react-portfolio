                        <Col>Hello, I'm Andr√© Miranda and I am a happy portuguese young developer living in Finland since 2014.</Col>
                        <Col>And why does a young portuguese guy move to Finland, you maybe be wondering? Well... actually that was all because of Football. Whaaatt?!
                        Yes.. football brought me from Portugal to Finland. The desire to meet new cultures and help to develop the football here, made me accept to
                        leave the warm Portugal and move to cold Finland. And I couldn't be more happy about my decision. It has been wonderful years since 2014 until now.</Col>
                        <Col>But what is a football coach doing here in the web development world, you're asking now?</Col>
                        <Col>Well... after more than a decade as a professional coach (in Portugal and Finland), I found out that my passion was moving towards 
                        another field. Trainings and games were being less and less interesting comparing with lines of code. So after lot of self-reflection, I decided to stop my sports career, and embrace
                        the world of Tech.</Col>
                        <Col>Since 2021 I decided to study full-time to became a web-developer. As a self-taught developer the road is defenitly not easy, but why not 
                        to take it, challenge it and see where I can go? I have been learning through online courses, reading books and articles and also by developing self-projects.</Col>
                        <Col>The motivation and eagerness to learn and get better is never missing and I wish to be able to enter in the Tech market in a near future.</Col>
                        <Col>And this is my nice story, from a young portuguese football coach turning into a web-developer in Finland. </Col>
